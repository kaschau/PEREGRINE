class block(Block):
    '''block object is the most basic object a raptorpy.multiblock.dataset (or one of its descendants) can be.

    Attributes
    ---------
    nblki : int
        Block number (not the index, so the first block has nblki = 1)

    connectivity : dict
        The connectivity attribute holds the connectivity information for the instance of the block object. It is actually a dictionary
        of dictionaries where the keys of the outer dictionary are numbers 1-6 representing the faces of the block. Each value of the outer
        dict is yet another dictionary holding the face information 'bc': boundary condition type, 'connection': the block connected to,
        and 'orientation': the orientation of the connection (in RAPTOR format). The default for these values is 'bc':'s1', 'connection':'0',
        'orientation':'000' for all faces. NOTE: the face information is stored as strings for all entries, even 'connection'
